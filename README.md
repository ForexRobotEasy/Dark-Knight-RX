# Dark Knight RX - Forex Trading Robot

This code is a sample implementation of the Dark Knight RX Forex Trading Robot, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It aims to implement a mean reversal strategy and adjust take-profit levels based on market volatility.

## How it Works

The code consists of several functions and constants:

### Libraries and Constants

- The necessary Trade library is included to handle trading operations.
- Constants for the take profit level, stop loss level, and stagnation zone threshold are defined.

### Trade Initialization

- The Trade object is initialized to handle trading operations.

### Mean Reversal Strategy

- The `MeanReversalStrategy` function is implemented to execute the mean reversal strategy.
- The price difference between the current price and the previous price is calculated.
- If the price difference exceeds the stagnation threshold, the direction of the trade is determined based on the price movement.
- Entry, take profit, and stop loss prices are calculated based on the current price.
- A trade position is opened using the `PositionOpen` function.

### Stagnation Zone Detection

- The `DetectStagnationZone` function is implemented to detect assertive stagnation zones.
- The mean price of the price history is calculated.
- If the current price is within the stagnation zone (within the threshold of the mean price), true is returned. Otherwise, false is returned.

### Take-Profit Level Adjustment

- The `AdjustTakeProfitLevel` function is implemented to adjust the take-profit level based on market volatility.
- The current price and current take-profit level of a trade position are retrieved.
- If the current price is outside the stagnation zone (with a difference larger than the threshold), a new take-profit price is calculated based on market volatility.
- The take-profit level of the trade position is modified using the `PositionModify` function.

### Entry Point

- The `OnTick` function serves as the entry point of the program.
- The current price and previous price are retrieved.
- The mean reversal strategy is implemented using the `MeanReversalStrategy` function.
- Price history is stored for stagnation zone detection.
- If an assertive stagnation zone is detected, take-profit levels of all open positions are adjusted using the `AdjustTakeProfitLevel` function.

## Product Description

Dark Knight RX is a Forex Trading Robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It implements a mean reversal strategy and adjusts take-profit levels based on market volatility. This robot aims to identify potential reversals in the market and take advantage of price movements.

Key Features:
- Mean Reversal Strategy: The robot analyzes price differences and enters trades when the price exceeds a specified threshold, indicating a potential reversal.
- Stagnation Zone Detection: The robot detects assertive stagnation zones by comparing the current price with the mean price of a price history. This helps to identify periods of low volatility.
- Take-Profit Level Adjustment: To adapt to changing market conditions, the robot dynamically adjusts take-profit levels based on market volatility. This helps to optimize profits and minimize losses.
